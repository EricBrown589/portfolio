            <h2>How I Got Into Coding</h2>
            <p id="early_life">
                I got into computers and technology at a young age. My first introduction was through computer gaming, which
                started with games such as: Command and Conquer: Generals, Sid Meier's Civilization III, and Black & White.
                I started finding myself thinking about how these games worked, as I started getting older I would find myself 
                wondering more and more how computers and the internet worked altogether. I would continue to question those 
                things and wonder about them for years to come. I eventually got my first taste at coding when I was 16 years 
                old and my dad had got me a Raspberry Pi. I didn't know how to use it or what to use it for but it introduced 
                me into the world of coding. A few years later, when I was around the age of 19, I tried to teach myself how
                to make a game, I used Google and Youtube as my teachers. That however, did not go so well, there was a lot I 
                still didn't understand and still needed to learn which was difficult to learn without an actual teacher. 
                Queue the present, I'm now in a software engineering class which was put together by the kind and wonderful people
                at Interapt and General Assembly. They came together to host this class for free and I was lucky enough to be 
                accepted and offered a spot!
